# FAQ

1. Why is Markdown better than a word processor?

First, Markdown is free to use unlike Microsoft Office products.

Second, Markdown helps user to create simple and static websites.

2. "Why is my resume not showing up?"

GitHub takes some time to update its repository so please return to your repository after some time.
